<h2>Using these controls</h2>
</font> 
The controls on this screen allow the dbo user (database owner) the ability to create, modify and delete users within
Easysoft Data Access for ISAM.<br>
The dbo user can also assign passwords to prevent unauthorized access.<br>
<font color="#FDB025"><h2>Notes</h2></font> 
<li>When changing the dbo's password, you must enter the old password otherwise the new password does not take effect.</li>
<li>If a user is selected for deletion upon pressing submit any rights you have granted for that user (via the Access Rights screen) are lost.  So if you later enable that user again, you will need to grant their rights again.</li><br>&nbsp;<br>
